                 Step 6: Add a new video by taking the user input about the name of the video and the time duration of the video .
                 Step 7: We will make a update option that will allow the user to update the name and time duration of the video. 
                 Step 8: Next one is the Delete option . It will allow the user to delete the existing video .
                 Step 9: The main meanu loop . It will be shown to the user untill the user exists the app.
                 Step 10: Finally to run the app we will use Run main().
