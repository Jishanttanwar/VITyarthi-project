 YouTube Video Manager

This is a small Python project I made to keep track of YouTube videos I plan to watch later. I usually forget which videos I saved or how long they were, so I wanted something simple that could store everything in one place without needing bookmarks or big apps.



 What This App Can Do
	•	Add a video with its name and duration
	•	Show the full list of all saved videos
	•	Change the name or time of any video
	•	Delete a video you no longer want to keep
	•	Save everything automatically so nothing gets lost

It runs in the terminal and uses a straightforward menu. There’s nothing complicated — just choose an option and follow the steps.



 How It Works (In Normal Language)

When you open the program:
	1.	It loads whatever videos you had saved earlier.
	2.	It shows a small menu.
	3.	You pick what you want to do.
	4.	The program updates the saved file so your changes stay there.

There isn’t any special setup or installation needed.



 Files in This Project
	•	youtubemanager_app.py → The main Python file
	•	youtube.txt → Where all your videos get saved



 How to Run It
	1.	Install Python if you don’t already have it.
	2.	Open your terminal or command prompt.
	3.	Go to the folder where this project is stored.
	4.	Run:

python3 youtubemanager_app.py




 Why I Made This ?

I wanted to practice Python basics like storing data, handling user input, using lists/dictionaries, and working with files. Instead of making something random, I decided to build a tool I’d actually use.

It solves a simple problem: remembering YouTube videos and how long they are.



 Ideas for Future Updates
	•	Show the total watch time
	•	Mark videos as watched
	•	Sort the list (alphabetical or by duration)
	•	Build a proper interface instead of using the terminal
	•	Turn it into a small mobile app later


 Summary

This is a small and simple project, but it’s practical and easy to understand. It’s a good example of how basic Python concepts can be used to make something useful. You can keep it as it is or build a bigger version from it.
